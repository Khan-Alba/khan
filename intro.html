            Dear, ms and mr. Guest.
            <br><br>
            Hello! I am Khan, a south-korean graduated student in a master's course of Linguistic Psychology.
            I am happy to meet you. This website is my data storage.
            I made it to practice my skills of html and css.
            I will try to make an improvment on both the website and my coding skills.
            Anyway, you are welcome and please leave any messages if you want to contact me.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely, Khan.
